# TDL – On the Ability of Neural Networks to Express Distributions

This project implements methods to compare two neural network architectures, following the approach presented in  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07028.

## Visualising Results

All important results are presented and can be reproduced in the notebook `main.ipynb`.

## Repository Structure

- `functions.py`: target functions and base probability distribution definitions  
- `models.py`: one- and two-hidden-layer MLP network definitions  
- `utils.py`: analysis functions used to compare the two models
